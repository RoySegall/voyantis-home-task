# Roy Segall voyantis home task

Welcome to my home task for voyantis.

## Set up:
As always:

```bash
npm i
```

Don't forget to run the server:

```bash
npm run server
```

and of course the client:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## How to interact with the app:

Go to ` http://localhost:5173/` and you will see the app. To add a queue click on `Create message` fill the forms. 

At the moment, there's no refresh after adding a message so you'll need to refresh the page to see changes.
